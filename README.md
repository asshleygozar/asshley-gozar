**`Aspiring Software Engineer (Mobile and Web Applications)`**

I’m currently a student pursuing a degree in Information Technology with a specialization in Mobile and Web Applications. I have a strong interest in understanding the underlying processes and concepts of software not just how they work, but why they work that way. I believe that grasping the “why” is just as important as learning the “how.”
